# Safeguarding Project

## This project aims to display easy-to-understand information on safeguarding practices, including how to recognise and respond to safeguarding concerns.

To do this it will include:
* A Hero Section: A Jumbotron with a brief statement about the importance of safeguarding, using a bold heading and a relevant image.

* Key Information Sections: Using Bootstrap’s grid system to divide the page into sections like “What is Safeguarding?”, “Signs to Watch For,” and “Action Steps.”

* Bullet Points for Action Steps: Presenting the safeguarding steps as a list using Bootstrap’s list group or standard bullet points, ensuring clarity.

* A Contact Section: Include a simple contact form or a list of important contacts, styled with Bootstrap’s form components, for reporting safeguarding concerns.
